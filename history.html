    <h4>IDEA</h4>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>- President John. F. Kennedy addressed a joint congress. Stating <i>"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth.”. </i>
                In 1963, another address was made for the U.S and the Soviet Union to join in the venture, as it was becoming costly, and the two nations were in midst of the "Cold War". President Kennedy was later killed that year and the idea never materialised. </li>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>NASA</h4>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>- At NASA, (previously NACA:1915- 1958), a team of scientists and engineers from different countries calculated, designed, and built everything for the expedition. Employing over 500,000, both internal and external contractors such as the <i>'Human Computers'</i>.
                These were individuals that manually calculated trajectories of space craft. individuals who were vital in this were women such as <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-names-headquarters-after-hidden-figure-mary-w-jackson" target="_blank" title="Mary Jackson">Mary Jackson</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/who-was-katherine-johnson-k4" target="_blank" title="Katherine Johnson" >Katherine Johnson</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/dorothy-vaughan-biography" target="_blank" title="Dorothy Vaughn">Dorothy Vaughn</a> and <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/320/margaret-hamilton/" target="_blank" title="Margaret Hamilton">Margaret Hamilton</a>. All woman recieved numerous accalades for their work. </li>
           <li>- Unmanned missions started off with flights designated <i><b>'AS-201' '-202' '-203’. </b></i> Then go on to become- <i><b>'Apollo 4', '5' & '6'.</b></i></li>
           <li>- Manned missions started off with <i><b>'Apollo 1'</b></i>. However due to the tragic deaths of Virgil Grissom, Edward White and Roger Chaffee, all manned mission were delayed until 1968. </li>

            <li>- <b>'Apollo 8'</b> tested the same vital systems and components, while also orbiting the Moon taking a total of 6 days. </li>
            <li>- <b>'Apollo 9'</b> took 10 days orbiting Earth fine tuning procedures and checks on crew, vehicles, and systems. </li>
